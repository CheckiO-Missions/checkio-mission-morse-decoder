        I will explain what you need to do. First, you need to split given code into words, focus on 3 spaces.
         Second, you need to take each part of splitted code and decode it using Morse code. And then join all parts together.
         New string must starts with capital letter.

        To split the given code you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.split">str.split()</a>.
         You can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=python+string+split+example">google</a> an example.
         Or look <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp">here</a>.

        I have gone halfway through. Need help!

        So, now you need to use two "for" loop. The first one is to walk through the words in splitted string. The second one
         is to walk through the letters in each word. Example:
        <pre class="brush: python">
for cod in code.split('   '):  # Here you split the given string into words
    # some text
    for i in cod.split():  # Here you split each word into letters
        # some text
        </pre>
    </div>

        I am stuck. I need a small hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Okay, we can add to our code 2 variables. First one is for our final result - "result", and the second one if for our intermediate result - "new".
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = []
for cod in code.split('   '):
    new = []  # This variable will reset every time when we finish the for loop below
    for i in cod.split():
        new.append(MORSE[i])  # And after successfully decryption we add letter to our
                              # "new" list
        </pre>
    </div>

        Still stuck...
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        So, according to the condition, our result must consist words, not letters. We need to use
         <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20join">''.join()</a>
         <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp">example</a>..
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = []
for cod in code.split('   '):
    new = []
    for i in cod.split():
        new.append(MORSE[i])
    result.append(''.join(new))  # At this point we add to our result a word
                                 # After this we return to the third row, where our
                                 # "new" will reset
                                 # And do the same with next word (if it exist)
        </pre>

        Tell me how to capitalize first letter

    <div class="answer">
        Use this
         <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20capitalize">str.capitalize()</a>.
        <pre class="brush: python">
